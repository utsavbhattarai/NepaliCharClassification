## Nepali Handwritten Character Recognition with Deep Learning

### Overview ðŸŽ‰
This project focuses on image classification using the Devanagari Handwritten Character Dataset (DHCD) for Nepali characters. Leveraging a pretrained ResNet model, the goal is to achieve accurate character recognition.

---

### Project Highlights ðŸš€
- Utilizes deep learning techniques for image classification.
- Training is performed on the DHCD (Nepali) dataset.
- Fine-tunes the ResNet model to improve its recognition capabilities.
- The model is designed to recognize handwritten Nepali characters.

ðŸ“œ ResNet101 undergoes transfer learning for the image classification process.
- Fine-tuning of ResNet101 is performed for the image classification task, following are the results after 5 epochs:
    - Test Accuracy Score: 0.9922
    - Train Accuracy Score: 0.8265
